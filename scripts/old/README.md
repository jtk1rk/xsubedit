These scripts were made for version 1.5.3 (2015).
The purpose were to install depedencies the package managers could not install.
I do not package any more for random distributions, so these scripts are dated,
but if you want to create a package yourself, you could get some clues
for the "hard to get" depedencies.
I only package for a distro after request, so if you want one for your distro
ask me at jtkirk at freemail dot gr.

Bottom line, these scripts are here only for historical reasons.
