This is a subtitle editor made for creating/translating subtitles to Greek Language.


Depedencies
-----------

The project is written in Python 2.7 using GTK+ 3 for GUI.
It also uses these modules: numpy, appdirs, regex, enchant, GtkSpell, chardet, cairo
And gstreamer as part of Gtk+ 3.
(You should install as many gstreamer plugins as you can so you can load as
many video codecs as possible)


There are also some external depedencies:

ffmpeg and mediainfo


Notes

The source need some serious cleanup, which will happen when I have spare time.
